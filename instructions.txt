The first (StartingData.csv) consists of user ids, starting account balances,
and what program the user is in. There are then 3 files with data about
deposits and withdraws.

Information about program 1:

   - Can avoid paying a $8 penalty per month if one of the following criteria is met:
        - deposited at least 300 per month
        - has at least 5 transactions per month
        - has at least 1200 in their account by the end of the month

Information about program 2:
   - Can avoid paying a $4 penalty per month if one of the following criteria is met:
        - deposited at least 800 per month
        - has at least 1 transaction per month
        - has at least 5000 in their account by the end of the month

Please write a script that determines:
1. which users have accrued penalties and how much each one owes
2. per month, which user deposited the most and how much it was
3. per month, which user had the most transactions and how many

Additional information:

Please spend no more than 3 hours on the coding challenge. Some people complete
the test, other do not. Either is fine, as we are most interested in your
thought process, the efficiency and simplicity of your solution, and the
quality and organizational structure of your code. Lastly, there is no need to
create a front-end interface for your answer.
